 		<h1>Greetings fellow Potterheads!</h1>
             <h2>Unless you just stumbled accross this amazing website and don't care about Harry Potter. In that case, LEAVE NOW! (Or stay, so you can become a Harry Potter fan like me)</h2>
             <div id="gryffindor">
 			<p>Gryffindor! Where dwell the brave at heart. Their daring, nerve, and chivalry Set Gryffindors apart. Everyone knows Gryffindors are the brave. 
            They can take on any challenge. (well, unless you're Ron Weasley and it involves spiders) Here are some facts about the Gryffindor house</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Their house crest animal is a lion</li>
                <li>Their colors are red and gold</li>
                <li>Gryffindor is the house of fire</li>
                <li>J.K Rowling is a Gryffindor (Too bad she's not a Ravenclaw)</li>
                <li>Godric Gryffindor was in favor of muggle-born wizards</li>
				<li>The sorting hat used to be Godric Gryffindor's fashion accesory</li>
				<li>Gryffindor often causes hatstalls</li>
				
                <p style="font-size:16">These facts come from Screenrant.com</p>
			</ul>
            </div>
			 
			<div id="ravenclaw">
 			<P>Ravenclaw! Where those of wit and learning will always find their kind. The best house of them all. (not at all biased ;P) Ravenclaw is the smartest house, and MY house. People believe that Hermione should've been in Ravenclaw, but the sorting hat put her in Gryffindor because she valued courage over learning. Here are some facts about Ravenclaw:</P>

		 <ul>
			<li>Their house crest animal is an eagle</li>
			<li>Their colors are blue and bronze</li>
			<li>Ravenclaw is the house of air</li>
			<li>The ravenclaw common room is the highest in Hogwarts</li>
			<li>Ravenclaws have to solve a riddle to get into their common room</li>
			<li>Professor Quirrel and Professor Lockhart were both Ravenclaws</li>
			<Li>A ravenclaw invented floo powder! (cool!)</Li>
			<li>Moaning Myrtle was a Ravenclaw</li>
			<li>Ravenclaw is a haven for eccentricity </li>
			<p style="font-size:16">These facts come from Screenrant.com</p>
		 </ul>
		 </div>

		 <div id="hufflepuff">
			<p>Hufflepuff! Where they are just and loyal. Those patient Hufflepuffs are true and unafraid of toil. Although I am a Ravenclaw, I have some Hufflepuff in me, too. The Hufflepuffs are hardly mentioned in the books, so you can't help but feel bad for them. They are kind and honest, so they probably don't get into too many crazy shenangians, but they are the calm between the storm. Here are some facts about Hufflepuff:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Their house crest animal is a badger</li>
				<li>Their house colors are yellow and black.</li>
				<li>The jewels used to track house points for Hufflepuff are diamonds</li>
				<li>Subjects involving plants or animals appeal to Hufflepuffs</li>
				<li>Hufflepuff is J.K Rowling's favorite house!</li>
				<li>The Hufflepuffs have a really interesting common room</li>
				<li>Helga Hufflepuff welcomed hundreds of house-elves in to kitchens and treated them with much respect, a thousand of years before Hermione's S.P.E.W</li>
				<li>A hufflepuff created Hogsmeade!</li>
				<li>Hufflepuffs were almost bears instead of badgers</li>

			 <h2>Hermione Granger's best quotes</h2>
			 <h3>I think all Harry Potter fans can agree that Hermione is an all around awesome character. She's got the bravery of Gryffindor, the smarts of Ravenclaw, the kindness of Hufflepuff, and she can keep secrets and make deals as well as a Slytherin might. In the movies and books alike, Hermione has had her fair share of great dialouge, so here are my favorite Hermione quotes:</h3>
			 <ul>
				 <li>"Are you sure that's a real spell , well it's not very good, is it?" <em>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's stone</em></li>
				 <li>"It's Levi-OH-sa, not Levi-oh-SAH!" <em>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's stone</em></li>
				 <li>"I'm going to bed, before either of you come up with another clever idea to get us killed, or worse, expelled." <em>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's stone</em></li>
				 <li>"Me? Books and cleverness. There are more important things: friendship and bravery.” <em>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone</em></li>
				 <li>"Fear of a name, only increases fear of the thing itself." <em>Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets</em></li>
				 <li>"At least no one on the Gryffindor team had to buy their way in, they got in on pure talent!" <em>Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets</em></li>
				 <li>*Hermione punches Draco* "That felt good."<em> Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban</em></li>
				 <li>"Just because it's taken you three years to notice, Ron, doesn't mean no one else has spotted I'm a girl.<em>Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire</em></li>
				 <li>"Just because you have the emotional range of a teaspoon, doesn't mean we all have!" <em>Harry Potter and the Order of the Pheonix</em></li>
				 <li>After seeing Ron kiss Lavender Brown: "Excuse me, I have to go and vomit"<em> Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince</em></li>
				 <li>"Mudblood and proud of it."<em> Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows</em></li>
			 </ul>
