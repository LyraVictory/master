        <h2>Chapter 1: Discovering The Secret</h2>
        <h4>Harry POV:

            Number 4 Privet Drive. That's where I live, if you can call it living. Day after day I'm tormented by my cousin Dudley and yelled at by my aunt and uncle. Even at school people ignore me, but that was all about to change.
            
            "Wake up, boy!" Aunt Petunia bangs on the door to my cupboard, and she doesn't even use my real name. Dudley is jumping up and down on the stairs above me, making quite the racket. I come into the kitchen for breakfast when I hear Uncle Vernon shout
            
            "Go get the post, now!" I walk over to the letterbox and sort through the usual bills and junk mail, there isn't anything important. Wait, what!? I have a letter! Mr. Harry Potter, number 4 Privet Drive, the cupboard under the stairs. How do they know about my cupboard?
            
            I walk back into the kitchen and place the rest of the mail on the table, trying to hide my letter from the Dursleys. No luck. Dudley notices the envelope in my hand and tries to grab it.
            
            "Mum, Dad! Harry's got something!" he announces, Uncle Vernon marches over and takes it from me.
            
            "Who would send you anything?" he asks rather accusingly and rips it half.
            
            I keep receiving the same letters for days after, and every time the Dursleys do anything to get rid of them. It just makes me so mad! They are my letters! On Sunday, Uncle Vernon is ecstatic, but I am feeling as bad as ever.
            
            "No post on Sundays!" he tells us that morning. Despite his attempt at boarding up the letterbox, the letters fly in not very much later through the fireplace. Not just a few, but hundreds of my letters. Whoever is sending me this really wants me to get it.
            
            The next day, the family packs up and leaves the house. We go somewhere very far away, probably where no letters can get to us. Uncle Vernon takes us to an extremely shabby looking hut on a big rock in the middle of nowhere.
            
            It is very late at night and I am awake because tomorrow is my 11th birthday. Not that birthdays are anything special for me, though. Just as it becomes midnight, the whole house shakes and the Dursleys wake up, startled. There is a loud bang on the door and Uncle Vernon pulls out his gun.
            
            "Who's there!" he says, cautiously awaiting danger. The door falls down with a thud and a giant creature, nearly twice the size as a normal human, enters. He has a scraggly, long black beard.
            
            "Happy Birthday Harry!" The man hands me a square box containing a slightly squashed birthday cake. The man says his name is Rubeus Hagrid, the gamekeeper at Hogwarts, whatever Hogwarts is. Hagrid hands me a letter. The same letter that I've been trying to get for over a week! I open it.
            
            Dear Mr. Potter,
            
            We are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted into Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Please find enclosed a list of all necessary books and equipment.
            
            Term begins on 1 September. We await your owl no later than 31 July.
            
            Yours sincerely,
            
            Minerva McGonagall, Deputy Head Mistress.
            
            I don't know how to react.
            
            Hermione POV:
            
            It was quite a surprise for us when I found out I was a witch, as neither my mum or dad were magic, nor knew anything about magic. But one day, I was having a nice family dinner when there was a knock on the door.
            
            "You aren't expecting anyone, dear, are you?" Mum asked Dad.
            
            "No, are you?" Dad replied.
            
            "I'm not expecting anyone either," I added, "So I don't know who it could be." Mum walked over to the door and opened it, and there, standing on our front porch, was a tall, graying lady, with her hair up in a bun. She looked polite but stern.
            
            "Hello, I am Minerva McGonagall and I am here to speak to you about your daughter, Miss Hermione." Now Dad and I were also standing at the door to meet this stranger.
            
            "What about her, Ma'am?" Dad asked
            
            "She possesses abilities unlike many in your world, and unknown to most."
            
            "What are you saying about our daughter?" Mum asked, slightly insulted,
            
            "She's a witch."
            
            Mum gasped, "How dare you say that about our daughter!" She was about to close the door when the lady said,
            
            "No, Ma'am. Hermione has been gifted with the ability to do magic, she just doesn't know how to use it. She has been deemed magic enough to attend Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry." The lady told us all about this magic school, how to buy school supplies, and how to get to the school. It was all so crazy and unbelievable!
            
            "Is all of this true, Ma'am?" I asked as she was about to leave. It was the first thing I had said since she introduced herself.
            
            "Now, why would I go through all this trouble, and think up this bizarre tale, just to trick you?" She had a point.</h4>
